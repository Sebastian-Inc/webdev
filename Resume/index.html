    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I have experience when it comes to cleaning and working in a work enviornment. I was raised in an environemt the
        encouraged cleaning and I used to help my mother with her housekeeping business.</p>
    <p> I worked at Little Ceasars
        which taught me a lot about the proper things to do in a work envioronment. I made sure to keep my work areas
        clean and I always made sure to think about others.</p>
